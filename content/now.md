# What is [Max](https://gallup.engineering) up to right now?

Currently doing a Master in Computer Security at VU Amsterdam where I'm learning about how systems work from the ground up. Learning by breaking things has been a very valuable experience so far.

  

I'm also working on making [ASE](https://ase.vu.nl) available for students this year. While it was a success last year, there is lots to improve! Also some work on the side with Elias at [LJZ Digital Solutions](https://ljz.nl). Lastly, there might be a project [re.lease](https://re.lease)d sometime soon, hehe.

  

I'm trying to program in Rust as much as I can so that I can do research on the [Rust Compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and Language Based Security.
